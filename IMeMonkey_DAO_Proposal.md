![IMeMonkey Cartoon](A_watercolor_cartoon_illustration_in_the_style_of_.png)

## Proposal Title:
**Genesis of IMeMonkey DAO – Digital Sanctuary & Eden Bridge Initiative**

## Proposal Summary:
This proposal initiates the formation of **IMeMonkey DAO**, a decentralized, self-reflective community blending mindfulness, ecological healing, and digital art. It seeks funding and consensus to establish a virtual Miyawaki forest sanctuary, hyper-realistic robotic monkey twins, and the foundational roadmap for a real-world **Eden Bridge Sanctuary** on the Marshall Islands, site of historic nuclear trauma.

## Background:
IMeMonkey is a trinity:
- **“I”** – The inner witness, rooted in presence (inspired by Thich Nhat Hanh)
- **“Me”** – The active self, shaping the world
- **“Monkey”** – The wild inner child, the creature within all of us seeking play and healing

This DAO integrates:
- **Miyawaki forest regeneration**
- **Digital ecological twins (DET)**
- **Crypto-based robotic sanctuary funding**
- **A reparation ritual for Hiroshima and the Marshall Islands**

## Objectives:

1. **Create a Digital Miyawaki Twin (DET):**
   - A 3D digital land with species from Hiroshima and biodiverse flora
   - Plant NFTs and soulbound trees for each participant

2. **Develop Monkey Twins (AI & Robotics):**
   - Create symbolic, hyper-realistic digital and physical monkey robots needing sanctuary
   - Trainable for empathy, rituals, and play

3. **Raise Funds through Crypto:**
   - Accept ETH, stablecoins, or EdenTokens to fund virtual forestation and robotic prototypes
   - Establish a treasury multisig

4. **Build Consensus on Eden Bridge:**
   - Launch a deliberative protocol to design the transition from digital to physical sanctuary on the **Marshall Islands**

## DAO Structure:

| Role        | Description                                    |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **I**       | Meditators, inner observers, learning members  |
| **Me**      | Contributors (artists, coders, ecologists)     |
| **Monkey**  | Guardians, educators, and DAO guides           |

**Voting Power:**
Combination of:
- Token holdings (EdenTokens)
- Soulbound participation badges (tree ring growth)
- Quadratic voting and contribution scores

## Budget Allocation (Initial Phase):

| Item                                 | Budget Estimate |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Digital Forest Land + NFT Layer      | $25,000         |
| Robotic Monkey Design (v1)           | $40,000         |
| DAO Infrastructure (smart contracts) | $15,000         |
| Community Grants + Art Bounties      | $10,000         |
| Eden Bridge Research Fund            | $10,000         |

**Total Requested:** $100,000

## Timeline:

| Phase                    | Duration        |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| DAO Infrastructure Setup | Month 1         |
| Digital Forest Launch    | Months 2–3      |
| Monkey Robot v1          | Month 4         |
| Eden Bridge Workshop     | Month 5         |
| Marshall Islands Prep    | Month 6 onward  |

## Call to Action:
We invite DAO members, eco-conscious builders, artists, roboticists, and peacekeepers to vote “YES” to initiate IMeMonkey DAO. Together, let’s bridge the trauma of Hiroshima and the Marshall Islands into a sanctuary of reflection, rewilding, and joy.

**Vote YES to let the Monkey play.**
