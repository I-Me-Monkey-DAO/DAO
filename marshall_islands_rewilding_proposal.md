## 1. Background and Rationale

The Marshall Islands, an indigenous sovereign Pacific nation, faces the existential threat of climate displacement, ecological degradation from past nuclear testing, and cultural fragmentation. In response, this proposal introduces an **Ecological Residency Program** grounded in:

- The **Akira Miyawaki method** of rapid native forest regeneration.
- **Indigenous-led biodiversity conservation**.
- **Symbolic healing** through **culinary and cultural expression**, particularly the **Fingermillet Dumpling Project**.
- A **peace alliance** connecting Hiroshima’s post-nuclear resilience with the Marshallese legacy.

---

## 2. Objectives

- **Rewild degraded atoll landscapes** with native and sacred vegetation using the Miyawaki method.
- Establish a **floating ecological residency hub** for artists, scientists, spiritual leaders, and Marshallese elders.
- Promote **biocultural resilience** through food sovereignty (e.g., finger millet), storytelling, and communal replanting.
- Symbolically address social stratification and displacement via the **"Parapets of Seeming"** food-art installation.
- Build a **trans-Pacific memory bridge** with Hiroshima—acknowledging mutual nuclear trauma and healing potential.

## 3. Key Components

### A. Miyawaki Sacred Grove Corridors

- Collaborate with Marshallese landowners, youth, and women’s collectives to identify rewilding sites.
- Use **indigenous species and matrilineal land knowledge** to restore native forest belts.
- Integrate **coconut groves, hiroshima flora, pandanus, and medicinal plants**.

### B. Ecological Residency

- A **modular floating or coastal retreat** center offering seasonal residencies.
- Hosted by Marshallese elders, international ecologists, peacebuilders, and ritualists.
- Outputs include micro-forests, films, ritual installations, and biodiversity credits research.

### C. Hiroshima-Marshall Peace Fellowship

- Annual exchange between Hiroshima peace scholars and Marshallese nuclear survivors.
- Includes collaborative art, memory walks, and co-created hiroshima miyawaki groves.

### D. Fingermillet Dumpling Project & Parapets of Seeming

- Monkey food forestry project where soya dumplings are shared across artificial boundaries—walls, wealth barriers, cultural divisions.
- Reimagines **destratification** through storytelling, shared meals, and breaking “parapets” made of symbolic materials (brick, sandbags, glass).
- Offers ancestral healing through Soya—**a climate-resilient grain** used by many indigenous peoples.

---

## 4. Outcomes

- **40+ Miyawaki groves** on atoll islands, with biodiversity maps and oral archives.
- A functioning **residency for rewilding diplomacy and indigenous peace**.
- Hiroshima-Marshall Islands alliance established and supported by UN platforms.
- **Public installations, a documentary, and global dissemination** of the Fingermillet Project.
- Models for **climate-displaced ecological citizenship** in Small Island Developing States (SIDS).

---

## 5. Partners and Platforms

- **UNEP, UNDRR, BCA**, Hiroshima Peace Institute, IUCN
- Local Marshallese NGOs, women’s weaving cooperatives, island youth collectives
- Artists, architects, and chefs with a commitment to decolonization and sacred ecology

## 6. Funding and Support Needed

- Initial seed funding: $300,000 USD for groves, residency hub, and program design
- In-kind partnerships with universities, indigenous networks, and rewilding NGOs
- Blockchain or Azure-based biodiversity credit system design and integration
